    "Berlin is the capital of Germany with about 3.7 million inhabitants and a city full of movement. On average, every Berliner travels more than three times a day. Local public transport plays a special role in this. Approximately 50 percent of Berlin's households are car-free, and with 324 cars per 1,000 inhabitants, the city has the lowest motorization rate in Germany. In addition, even people who do have a car often use other means of transportation. Public transportation also plays a central role for commuting to work. For example, about 40% of all commuters use public transportation. [1] \n",
    "\n",
    "Another strongly growing trend is the demand for organic products and therefore incoming, the desire for a healthy diet [2]. In train stations and metro stations, there are already numerous possibilities for food intake, and so numerous small and large stores offer food and drinks to take away. However, these offers are very often not considered healthy at all and thus contradict the desire for a healthy diet. The market for healthy take-away products is still relatively small and this results in a large potential market for investors.  \n"

Given all the venues surrounding them, the stations are clustered using K-means algorithm. The number of optimal <b>clusters</b> is decided using the elbow method and silhouette score. Each cluster is separately analyzed to examine one discriminating venue that characterizes them. Analysis of the clusters and visualization will give insights as to where the strategic regions to set up the business.\n",
